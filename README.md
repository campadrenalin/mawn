Man pages, but with more awesomeness.

Mawn is a help resource that gets you to what you're looking for, fast, without getting in your way or dumping too much information at you at once. It's kinda like if Wikipedia was a console application. Mawn pages are designed to be informative, clear, easily digestible and broken into just the right size chunks. It also aims to have a lot more examples, recipes, and explanations.

Like man, it's self-documenting. Unlike man, it doesn't use a pager by default, it helps you find the part of the documentation you actually want, and consists of a single simple shell script.

This program and its resources are currently in very early development, and missing niceties such as .gz compression support, but most importantly, the pages are extremely sparse, to the point of essentially being examples on how pages should be, rather than a proper library. You can help fill it out, migrating data from man pages and writing/editing existing pages.

While the first day mawn existed was 10/18/12, it wasn't really usable until the next day, October 19. Community fans will appreciate the coincidence. May the warm feelings of 10/19 fill your heart as you use this software.

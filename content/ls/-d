FLAG -d, --directory : Don't list directory contents

    This flag will prevent ls from doing what it usually
    does with directory arguments - expand them. If I'm
    in my home folder, and I do "ls *", it will print
    out the contents of every subfolder in my home folder.
    If I do "ls -d *", the results will be ironically less
    trippy, and equivalent to regular old "ls".

    This flag also prevents the dereferencing of symbolic
    links.

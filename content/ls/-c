FLAG -c : Show and sort by ctime

    "ctime" is a piece of data representing the last time
    that the file status information was modified.

    This flag behaves differently depending on what other
    flags are present:

WITH -lt:
    Sorts by and shows ctime column

WITH -l:
    Shows ctime and sorts by name

OTHERWISE:
    Just sort by ctime.

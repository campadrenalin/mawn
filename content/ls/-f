FLAG -f : Don't sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color.

    This flag does a bunch of things at once.

1. List all the stuff in the folder (-a)
2. Don't sort, use the order the filesystem has (-U)
3. Disables long-form output (-l disabled)
4. Disables printing filesize (-s disabled)
5. Disables colored output (--color disabled)

    For this kind of flag, order matters. I can have my -f
    and --color too, as long as I remember to put the
    --color flag AFTER the -f flag, for example.

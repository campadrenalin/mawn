FLAG --block-size=SIZE : Control the way filesize is printed.

    This flag lets you explicitly say what units you want
    filesize printed in. Default is bytes, but when working
    with large files, those can be painfully small units to
    reason in.

    This option does nothing if filesize isn't already
    being printed, usually through -l.

--block-size=KB

    Print file sizes in kilobytes (1000 bytes)

--block-size=K

    Print file sizes in kibibytes (1024 bytes)

--block-size=MB

    Print file sizes in megabytes (1000 kilobytes, 1000 x 1000 bytes)

--block-size=M

    Print file sizes in mebibytes (1024 kibibytes, 1024 x 1024 bytes)

And so on, for G, T, P, E, Z, and Y.

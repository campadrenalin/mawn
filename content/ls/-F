FLAG -F, --classify : Append indicator to entries

    Indicators are one-character sigils to... indicate
    things about the files. The -F flag adds indicators
    to the end of every entry with an interesting nature:

somefile

    No indicator, just a regular file

someprogram*

    A file that's marked as executable.

somedirectory/

    A directory.

symboliclink@

    A link to another place in the filesystem.

    "mawn ln" for more details.

somefifo|

    A FIFO is like a pipe and a file at the same time.

    "mawn mkfifo" for more details.

unixsocket=

    A UNIX socket, for network-like communication over the
    local machine. Used in things like MySQL.

somedoor>

    A type of local procedure call. Not used very widely,
    mostly on Solaris.

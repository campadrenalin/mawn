FLAG -i, --inode : Print the inode number of each file.

    UNIX systems assign unique "inode numbers" to files.
    A file can be in two different places, if both those
    places point to the same inode - and changes to one
    place will affect the other, because it's the same
    file underneath.

    You can use the -i flag to get a peak under the hood.

FLAG -N, --literal : Print raw entry names

    Don't give control characters in entry names special
    treatment or escaping. This means that if you have, for
    example, some filenames that include terminal codes for
    changing the color, those will actually change the
    output color during output.

    You usually don't want to do this, as printing random
    characters without the protection of ls's automatic
    escaping can really mess up your terminal state. If
    that happens, you can probably fix most (if not all) of
    the problems by running "reset", but don't be surprised
    if your terminal state is beyond repair.

FLAG -H, --dereference-command-line : Follow explicitly listed symlinks

    By default, ls follows symlinks. But some flags disable
    this behavior, so you can more safely list directory
    contents in situations where you could end up in an
    endless loop.

    This flag overrides THOSE flags, but only for paths
    explicitly included in the parameter list.

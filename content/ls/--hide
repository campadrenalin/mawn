FLAG --hide=PATTERN : Exclude some entries from results.

    PATTERN can be any shell pattern, from one file to a
    widely encompassing glob*. ls will not print files
    matching the pattern. 

    You can have multiple uses of this flag in a command,
    for example "ls --hide=m* --hide=*.pyc"

    An important limitation to note is that it only hides
    IMPLIED results. Anything that is explicitly listed as
    a parameter will be included regardless of --hide flags.
    For example, "ls --hide=m*" would hide the files 
    "music" and "magic", "ls --hide=m* music" would just
    hide magic, and "ls --hide=m* m*" would hide nothing.

    All uses of --hide are always overridden by -a and -A,
    no matter what order they are provided in the argument
    list (see "mawn ls -a" and "mawn ls -A").

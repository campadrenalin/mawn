FLAG --color[=WHEN] : Colorize the output.

    ls determines when to make the output colorful based on
    two things: the LS_COLORS environmental variable, and
    the --color flag, which overrides it.

--color=never

    Don't colorize anything.

--color=auto

    Colorize only when outputting to a terminal. This means
    that the color codes won't be, say, passed down a pipe
    to some other program that can't interpret them.

    This is what the default setting for LS_COLORS is on
    many desktop distros, tied with "never".

--color=always

    Colorize no matter where the output is going. This is
    useful if you want to pass color codes into a pipe or
    file on purpose.

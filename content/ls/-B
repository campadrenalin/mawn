FLAG -B, --ignore-backups : Do not list implied entries ending with ~

    Files that end with ~ are generally backup files from
    various programs. -B will make ls ignore them - except
    ones you specifically list in the arguments.

    For example, let's say you were in a folder with two
    files, X~ and Y~. "ls -B" would list neither of them.
    "ls -B X~" would list X~ but not Y~.
